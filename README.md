# Personalized Student Plan Generator
Check out the [Demo](https://personalizedcourse-b82204583c81.herokuapp.com/) to see the Personalized Student Plan Generator in action.

The Personalized Student Plan Generator is a project designed to assist students in planning their academic course load based on their transfer documents from assist.org, IGETC requirements, preferred class load per quarter, and classes of interest. The frontend of this application is implemented as a Discord bot, allowing users to upload their assist.org course requirement document and specify their preferences for class distribution across quarters and summers. The bot utilizes data structures and algorithms, including a greedy algorithm, to create a balanced and sequential course plan for each student.

## Features

- Upload your assist.org course requirement document.
- Set preferences for maximum classes per quarter and summer.
- Specify classes of interest, such as Math, ECON, PSYC.
- The bot employs a greedy algorithm to create a well-balanced course plan.
- Sequential ordering of classes based on prerequisites.
- Receive a customized course plan tailored to your requirements.

## Greedy Algorithm Interval Scheduling Implementation
The core of the Personalized Student Course Plan Generator relies on a greedy algorithm interval scheduling approach to create a balanced and optimized course plan for students. The algorithm takes into account the user's transfer requirements, class load preferences, and interests to generate a plan that best fits their needs.
